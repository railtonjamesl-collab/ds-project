## R Markdown

In this section we will be using some loan data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/taweilo/loan-approval-classification-data?resource=download by performing some exploratory data analysis techniques on this data set. This is a sythetic data set which provides information on individuals along with their loan status (approved or rejected).


```{r Libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(Hmisc)
```

```{r Data}
loan <- read_csv("~/University of Bristol/Semester 1/Data Science Toolbox/Assessments/Assessment 0/ds-project/dataset/loan_data.csv", col_types ="nffnnfnfnnnnff")
head(loan,10)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
