# Data Science Toolbox Formative Coursework 0: Data Review and group work primer

This project looks at various datasets across finance including stock indices, stock prices and loan data. 

Our dataset sources include Kaggle and Yahoo Finance.

The code we found explores techniques such as linear regression, technical analysis looking at moving averages and random forests to detect fraudulent card transactions.

Our work ultimately highlights the variety of datasets within finance and the different methods and code that can be used to investigate those datasets. This provides a good foundation to inform the direction of our work in later projects as well as familiarising ourselves with GitHub and R.
