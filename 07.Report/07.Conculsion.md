# Conclusion

In this project, we worked with multiple types financial data and explored a variety of tools/methods to analyse and model them. Additionally, we came to grips with the difficulties of the Git/GitHub interface.

Through our collective work, we have:
- Predicted credit fraud using random forest and logistic regression.
- Conducted technical analysis on stock data and predicted closing price using linear regression.
- Performed rigorous statistical tests such as the Shapiro-Wilk and Durbin-Watson tests.
- and are performing analysis to indicate likelihood of loan approval.

Moving forward we plan to converge on single project ideas that we can all contribute towards. To start, we could combine some of our insights, for example, comparing the logistic regression and random forest approaches on identical datasets.
